# Memesagram
Did you code all day and your oAuth is not working yet?
Are you tired of coding?
Is Node.js bugging you?
What do you think about ID's?
Are you looking for Demetrious?
How is CSS treating you these days?
Some headaches?
Spend a few minutes in Memesagram for coders and refresh your head.
